<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>If you are looking for some materials to prepare for the Magento Certified Developer exam then you're in the right place!<br />
We've started gathering some study resources. You can find them by clicking links on the left. You can click on the files references too
 and the content of the files will be displayed.</p>
<h2>What is this Magento Study Guide?</h2>
<p>This website was created when I wanted to have quick reference to all my study materials in one place.
 I've gathered all notes and all the files mentioned in the official preparation document published
 by Magento <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/certification/" target="_blank">here</a> when I was preparing for the certification and I learned from them. Then I thought that this materials can
 help other people to prepare for the exam too, so, here you go!</p>
<h2>What this Magento Study Guide is not?</h2>
<p>Materials gathered on this website are not answers to the actual questions which will be on the certification exam.
 I don't know what the questions will be. However Magento gave some indication regarding the materials which will be covered.
 That's how we have this.</p>
<p>This website is also not a marketing venture. It's made by community and for community. However if I'm grabbing materials
 from other people's websites, I ask them for permission to place them here in exchange for a link and putting their logo on <a href="/who-contributed/">THE "CONTRIBUTORS" PAGE OF FAME</a>.
